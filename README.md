# 🩺 ECG-Image-Compression

This repository contains the codebase for the Final Year Project titled:

**"Comparative Research on ECG Image Compression: Assessing Diagnostic Integrity"**

The goal of this project is to explore and compare different image compression techniques for ECG paper images, focusing on preserving diagnostic accuracy while improving storage efficiency.

---

## 📦 Compression Techniques Implemented

This project investigates **three base compression methods**:

-  **Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)**
-  **Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE)** 
-  **Context-Adaptive Lossless Image Compression (CALIC)**

To enhance compression performance, **entropy coding techniques** are combined with these base methods:

-  **Huffman Coding (HC)**
-  **Arithmetic Coding (AC)**

## 📂 Dataset

The ECG image dataset used in this study is derived from the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database**.  
Each ECG signal was first visualized as a 2D image, then resized and preprocessed before applying the compression methods.

---

## ⚙️ Preprocessing Steps

1. **Read Data**: Load raw ECG waveform images.
2. **Resize**: Standardize all images to a fixed size.
3. **Apply Compression**: Use one of the selected methods listed above.
4. **Evaluate Results**.

---

## 📈 Performance Metrics

Each compression method was evaluated based on the following metrics:

- 📏 **Compression Ratio (CR)** – Ratio of original to compressed size.
- 📊 **Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)** – Image quality after compression.
- 🧠 **Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)** – Structural similarity to the original.
- 📉 **Percentage Root Mean Square Difference (PRD)** – Diagnostic distortion measure.
- ⏱ **Processing Time** – Time taken for compression and decompression.
