# ECG-Image-Compression

These is the code for the Final Year Project " COMPARATIVE RESEARCH ON ECG IMAGE COMPRESSION: ASSESSING DIAGNOSTIC INTEGRITY  "
In this responsive are include the 3 base method of the compression:
- Discrete wavelet transform (DWT)
- Convolutional autoencoder (CAE)
- Context-adaptive lossless image compression (Calic)

Base on the comparison, in this project have add the entropy coding as the hybrid comprssion with the 3 base method above
- Huffman Coding (HC)
- Arithmetic Coding (AC)

The final method the have in this project:
- DWT
- DWT + HC
- DWT + AC
- CAE
- CAE + HC
- CAE + AC
- CALIC
- CALIC + HC
- CALIC _AC
