# ü©∫ ECG-Image-Compression

This repository contains the codebase for the Final Year Project titled:

**"Comparative Research on ECG Image Compression: Assessing Diagnostic Integrity"**

The goal of this project is to explore and compare different image compression techniques for ECG paper images, focusing on preserving diagnostic accuracy while improving storage efficiency.

---

## üì¶ Compression Techniques Implemented

This project investigates **three base compression methods**:

-  **Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)**
-  **Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE)** 
-  **Context-Adaptive Lossless Image Compression (CALIC)**

To enhance compression performance, **entropy coding techniques** are combined with these base methods:

-  **Huffman Coding (HC)**
-  **Arithmetic Coding (AC)**

## üìÇ Dataset

The ECG image dataset used in this study is derived from the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database**.  
Each ECG signal was first visualized as a 2D image, then resized and preprocessed before applying the compression methods.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Preprocessing Steps

1. **Read Data**: Load raw ECG waveform images.
2. **Resize**: Standardize all images to a fixed size.
3. **Apply Compression**: Use one of the selected methods listed above.
4. **Evaluate Results**.

## üìà Performance Metrics

Each compression method was evaluated based on the following metrics:

- üìè **Compression Ratio (CR)** ‚Äì Ratio of original to compressed size.
- üìä **Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)** ‚Äì Image quality after compression.
- üß† **Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)** ‚Äì Structural similarity to the original.
- üìâ **Percentage Root Mean Square Difference (PRD)** ‚Äì Diagnostic distortion measure.
- ‚è± **Processing Time** ‚Äì Time taken for compression and decompression.
